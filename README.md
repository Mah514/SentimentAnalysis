Sentiment Analysis through Machine Learning


Humans are great at recognizing faces and emotions. This code explores how well simpler machine learning models can classify human emotions. Seven supervised machine learning mod-els are pitted against computer vision and deep learning to see if they can rival their performance. It is already known that computer vision and deep learning can effectively solve this task, but this project explores how simpler models, that others might overlook, perform in the same task. All seven models are trained using hyper parameter search and cross fold validation to get the best result. Results show that these models poorly performand only after applying some simple computer vision techniques do we see an increase in performance, meaning that this task should not behandled by these simpler models as is.
